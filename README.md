1. Flask Phonebook
   - framework: Flask
   - database: sqlite
   - This project is a simple phonebook application built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It showcases basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contacts. The application is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating how to implement CRUD functionality in a Flask application.
